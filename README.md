This [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) extension provides support for the [julia programming language](http://julialang.org/).

## Getting started

Once the extension is installed it needs to find the julia binary on your system. There are two options: if your julia binary is on the path and you have not configured something else, the extension will use that version of julia. Alternatively, you can set the ``julia.executablePath`` configuration setting to point to a julia binary, in which case the extension will always use that version of julia. To edit your configuration settings, execute the ``Preferences: Open User Settings`` command, and then make sure your user settings include the ``julia.executablePath`` setting. The format of the string should follow your platform specific conventions, and be aware that the backlash ``\`` is the escape character in JSON, so you need to use ``\\`` as the path separator character on Windows.

## Features

## Development information

The file julia.tmLanguage for this extension was generated by running the [Yo Code - Extension Generator](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/tools/yocode) for VS Code with this [Julia.tmLanguage file](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Julia.tmbundle/blob/696f630736669251a3cb56cb27741b5b07a4c093/Syntaxes/Julia.tmLanguage) as input.
