# Julia (Insider)

This is the insider (preview) version of the [Julia VS Code extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org/). Most users should _not_ use this version, but instead install the [normal version](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia) of the extension. This version of the extension may contain unstable prerelease code.

Please note that you should _not_ have the regular and insider version of the extension installed at the same time.

The Julia extension for Visual Studio Code collects usage data and sends it to the development team to help improve the extension. Read our [privacy policy](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode/wiki/Privacy-Policy) to learn more and how to disable any telemetry.
